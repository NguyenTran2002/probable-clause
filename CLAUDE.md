# CLAUDE.md

Working file for the agent. The spec is `PROBABLE_CLAUSE_KICKOFF.md` (the brief); read it in full at the start of every session.

## Rules that always apply

- At the end of each phase or session, append an entry to `BUILD_LOG.md`.
- This brief is frozen. `docs/design/locked-decisions.md` holds every later decision and wins over the brief.
- Every time written anywhere comes from `date`, run immediately before writing it. Never estimate a time.
- Before a planned compaction, update "Current state and next step".

More, each from the brief:

- **Dates shown to a person are America/Chicago**, converted explicitly (`TZ=America/Chicago date`; in code, `zoneinfo`). Never take a date from a UTC timestamp (§10.7).
- **Never read or edit `.env`.** `.claude/settings.json` denies it. Check secrets with `uv run python scripts/check_env.py [--phase N]`, which prints only set / empty / missing / commented out. Ask the user to fill `.env` before the first step that needs a secret.
- **BUILD_LOG.md is append-only.** Entry format in brief §10.2. The DECISION line records only the user's judgement, quoted where useful. Run `date` right before writing the heading, and commit right after appending.
- **Git:** commit as you go; never squash, rebase, amend pushed commits, or force-push; tag `phase-<n>-done` at each phase end; stays local until the user says to push; never commit a session transcript.
- **No `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg` file is ever committed** (locked-decisions P0.4). `.gitignore` blocks them; don't force-add one. The project's own `.svg` and `.ico` files are allowed.
- **No absolute local paths** in any committed file. Use repo-relative paths or `~`.
- **Counts come from scripts**, never by eye. **Timeouts and retries name their basis** (a measurement, or "placeholder until measured"). A paid request is never retried automatically.
- **Restate before acting** when an instruction reads two ways (brief §0). Stop and ask in every case in brief §12.
- **Any deploy, any `gcloud` command that creates or changes cloud resources (scaling included), and any change to goodnight: only on the user's explicit green light.**
- Wording: status word is "working"; never "exhaustive", "comprehensive", "settled law", "guaranteed accurate", "citator", "no hallucinations" (brief §10.6).

## Stack (locked-decisions P0.1)

- Python 3.13 via uv (`.python-version` pins 3.13). FastAPI on uvicorn. Frontend chosen in Phase 3.
- `uv sync` to install; `uv run python <script>` to run. Dependencies are added with `uv add` when the code that needs them arrives.

## Layout

- `PROBABLE_CLAUSE_KICKOFF.md`: the brief, frozen.
- `BUILD_LOG.md`: the raw record, append-only.
- `docs/design/locked-decisions.md`: every decision after the brief.
- `scripts/check_env.py`: reports which secrets are set.
- `scripts/probe_courtlistener.py`: one authenticated request to confirm the CourtListener token works.
- `.env.example`: the variable names; the user creates `.env`.

## Environment quirks (from the previous build)

- `uv run uvicorn` stalled in the preview tool: launch `.venv/bin/uvicorn` directly.
- `preview_start` failed with `EPERM`: serve from a background shell instead.
- The shell is **zsh, which does not split an unquoted variable.** Write `gcloud` flags out in full; never pass them through a variable.
- Claude Code transcripts live outside the repo, under `~/.claude/projects/`. `cleanupPeriodDays` stays unset at the user's direction (P0.5); don't change it.
- **CourtListener limits for the user's EDU account: 20 requests a minute, 1,000 an hour** (stated by the user, Oct 23, 2026). Pace below both, serially, and cache every raw response so nothing is fetched twice.

## Two sessions in one checkout (from Phase 4, locked-decisions P0.3)

The frontend will be built by a second Claude Code session in this same folder and branch. The rules (one writer per file; the frontend session writes only `web/` and `docs/sessions/frontend-log.md`; commit only your own paths by name; no stash, reset, `checkout -- .` or branch switch; only the main session writes the shared docs and tags) are in P0.3. A fuller "If you are the frontend session" section is added here before that session starts.

## Current state and next step

- **State:** Phase 0 (Bootstrap) done: git initialized with the brief as the first commit, scaffold in place, tagged `phase-0-done`. Locked so far: P0.1 to P0.3.
- **Next:** Phase 1 (Corpus). It starts by settling the inclusion rule with the user (brief §4.1, including the *Riley* tension). Before the first CourtListener call, the user fills `.env` and runs `uv run python scripts/check_env.py --phase 1`; then read the actual rate limits on the user's CourtListener profile page (§4.2).
